		<h1>Locally UX research and design</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>About Locally</h2>
			<p>I wanted to create a real world project where I could practice my UX knowledge and develop new skills. I found the problem of finding a better way to save and retrieve interesting places and tried to solve it with my project called Locally.</p>
			<p>This case study describes Locally's UX process of discovery, validation, design and testing.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Interviewing process</h2>
			<p> I spent a few weeks being more aware of people's frustrations through everyday conversations and came up with a few potential problems. The struggle of saving and retrieving interesting places was the first one validated.</p>
			<p>To validate this problem, I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rcgibkEFFUVtlkhiDW3UnlNYS6kEqyEFdHhd4V2WbS8/edit?usp=sharing">UX research plan</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12ONlmXoxyG5LGo0uxx1hK5Kofy6ovsbFqUJ-cop-GqM/edit?usp=sharing">interviewed 6 people</a>. The main questions I wanted answers from were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What kind of places would you like to go to?</li>
				<li>How do you remember places you would like to go to?</li>
				<li>How do you find the places you would like to go to?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some common threads came up:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Most people used multiple ways to store locations they were interested in, including note-taking apps for different devices, text documents, pieces of paper or just memory.</li>
				<li>When looking for local places to go out or looking for cool places when visiting a new city, it was hard to know where to go.</li>
				<li>Opportunities to visit places were lost as places were forgotten, distance misjudged and planning lacking.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Empathy map & Personas</h2>
			<p>An empathy map helped me organize interviews' results into users' feelings and actions.</p>
			<img src="locally-empathy-map.png" alt="Empathy map"/>
			<p>Two personas with different motives and lifestyles were created to represent our audience.</p>
			<div class="full-screen">
				<ul class="plain">
					<li class="persona">

As an introvert, he doesn't like to go out by himself but enjoys knowing which restaurant to go to when going out with friends. He gets a lot of recommendations from his family/friends abroad, local friends, coworkers, acquaintances but doesn't have a good system to store these recommendations and have them resurfaced when the appropriate time and location comes.</dd>

			<h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
			<div>
				<div class="main-left">
					<p>After our audience was defined, it was time to research websites/apps/tools solving problems similar to ours. The research included social media, tour guides and planning products.</p>
					<p>This research led us to questions we will eventually have to answer:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How to view locations?</li>
						<li>How to add locations?</li>
						<li>Do we implement notifications and if yes, how?</li>
						<li>How do we verify places?</li>
						<li>How do we categorize places?</li>
						<li>Can we share places and if yes, how?</li>
						<li>Can we plan itineraries and if yes, how?</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<figure class="side-right" >

			<h2>Card sorting</h2>
			<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tF7iJmf1YXsUFIGaLA36glGCZF0wwqbjkKhezny2Fss/edit?usp=sharing">Four live card sorting sessions</a> were performed to understand how to display and organize content.
			</p>
			<img src="locally-card-sorting-example.png" alt="Card sorting of 3rd participant"/>
			<p>Those sessions helped us better understand the classifications of places, users' goals as well as focus on individual places and not maps or itineraries.</p>
			<p>Locations were divided within 2 classifications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>favorite, bucket list or back-pocket item</li>
				<li>close-by or far</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Users had 4 main goals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>recommend places to people</li>
				<li>find favorite places</li>
				<li>find places for a specific city</li>
				<li>find unvisited locations</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some cards ("bike paths", "maps of places to see while visiting a city" and "your cousin's traveling places") were too general and confused participants as they didn't describe a specific place. It will be more important to focus on storing/retrieving individual places than figuring out how they fit into an organized maps or itineraries.</p>

			<h2>User testing v1</h2>
			<div>
				<div class="main-left">
					<p>Once I understood users' goals, and places' classification better, a sitemap and wireframes were created and user testing implemented.</p>
				</div>	
				<figure class="side-right">	
					<img src="locally-sitemap-v1.png" alt="Sitemap v1"/>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="full-screen three-five full-top">
				<span class="full-title">Home/Add place/Categories wireframes v1</span>
				<img src="locally-wireframes-v1-welcome.png" alt="Homepage wireframe"/>
				<img src="locally-wireframes-v1-add-place.png" alt="Add place wireframe"/>
				<img src="locally-wireframes-v1-categories.png" alt="Place categories wireframe"/>
			</div>
			<div class="full-screen four-five full-bottom">
				<span class="full-title">Main menu wireframes v1</span>

				<img src="locally-wireframes-v1-menu-3.png" alt="All places wireframe"/>
				<img src="locally-wireframes-v1-menu-4.png" alt="User info/settings wireframe"/>
			</div>
			<p>During the first round of user testing, I showed users wireframes and asked for their first general impressions: what did they think the app do? where would they click and why?</p>
				<p>After testing the v1 wireframes, I realized that the main menu was confusing as places could appear in more than one menu items. I had to find a better way to differentiate close-by/favorite/new places and to find places per cities. The places categories feature was successful and was kept in the following version.</p>

			<h2>User testing v2</h2>
			<div>
				<div class="main-left">
					<p>For v2, I rethought the main menu while still keeping the close-by/favorite/new types within the app, made city/country search easier, added on-boarding process and streamlined the look with logo and icons.</p>
			    </div>
				<figure class="side-right">	
					<img src="locally-sitemap-v2.png"  alt="Sitemap v2"/>

				<div class="full-screen five-five full-top">

					<span class="full-title">Location view/Categories/Notifications v2</span>

				<img src="locally-wireframes-v2-categories.png"  alt="Place categories wireframe"/>
				<img src="locally-wireframes-v2-notification.png" alt="Close-by place notification"/>
				</div>
				<p>The v2 user testing consisted in 3 in-person usability sessions using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mrJUmxePDSAGYwVNb1TjzBK8JTEWiAVN2Ti_y3-fKLM/edit?usp=sharing">user testing script</a> and interactive wireframes on <a href="https://popapp.in/">popapp</a>. I ask the users to perform 5 tasks:
				<ol>
					<li>Describe the homepage</li>
					<li>Create an account</li>
					<li>Find closest locations to where (s)he was now</li>
					<li>Find locations in a specific city</li>
					<li>Add location</li>
				</ol>	
				</p>

				<p>Three usability problems stood out:
					<ul>
						<li>The words used for locations types (favorite, bucket list, back pocket) were confusing</li>
						<li>Search required too many steps</li>
						<li>The welcome/onboarding needs to be more in-depth</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>A more detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Si_XVJaU0s8qQ4gFjmBWNDUJ3g453yFstV8LzRgJay0/edit?usp=sharing">user testing report</a> with wireframe updates is available.</p>

			<h2>MVP & user stories</h2>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Once a device is chosen, MVP's user stories can start being implemented. At the same time, wireframes needs to be worked out with at least another round of user testing sessions and eventually polished wireframes following the style guide needs to be created with Sketch.</p>
			<p>Locally was a fun project to practice my UX skills and become more familiar with the UX process. I have a few ideas on improvements/changes but for now, I am calling the project done with a potential extension if I decide to work with Sketch and/or learn Android development.</p>
