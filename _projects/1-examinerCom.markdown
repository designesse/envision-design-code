	<h2>About Examiner.com</h2>
	<p>Examiner.com was one of the biggest new websites and built on Drupal, a PHP content management system.</p>
	<p>Our team of less than 10 people included a product manager, a designer and front-end/back-end/full stack developers. I was a full stack developer. Most of my days involved writing PHP, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and the remaining time included code/design reviews and collaborating on decision-making.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<div class="float-left">
			<p>Examiner.com was built as 2 websites: desktop and mobile. In order to create a more consistent and enjoyable experience for the users and ease features update for the dev and content teams, we decided to redesign the examiner.com product with a responsive overhaul.</p>
			<p>For a better user experience, our goals were to focus on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>merging the 2 websites into one responsive website,</li>
				<li>refining the menu,</li>
				<li>displaying more relevant content on article pages,</li>
				<li>improving content creation.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2>Responsive design strategy</h2>
	<p>A new color palette and a better theme for content display and discovery were the base for the redesign. We made sure to use HTML5 tags, CSS3 properties and Sass to be up-to-date with the newest standards and technologies. Also, we created multiple JavaScript scripts for more real-time and interactive features, including for the creation of complex content types.</p>

	<h2>The new Examiner.com's reveal</h2>
	<p>After a few months, the new responsive website was released live successfully. The unified website, updated look and improved features were major improvements from our previous version and were a stepping stone for more user engagement and reach in future projects.</p>
