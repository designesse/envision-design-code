	<p>I am a UX/Product Designer based out of Colorado. My journey to design or Colorado doesn't follow a simple path so instead of writing an extended biography, below are 5 facts about me that influenced my personal and professional journey.</p>
</section>

<section class="project">
	<h3 class="center long marg-bot"> 1. My UX journey started with "The Design of Everyday Things" by Don Norman. </h3>
	<p class="center long"> In college, I took an impromptu human-centered design class to get a break from my engineering classes. I read this assigned book and have been rethinking all my daily interactions ever since. </p>
</section>

<section class="project">	
	<h3 class="center long marg-bot"> 2. Creating journey maps and speeches is really similar. </h3>
	<p class="center long"> Getting inside your users' heads, defining stages, using words or visuals to initiate reactions out of people, testing for users' reactions are all necessary steps to creating a journey map or speech. </p>
</section>

<section class="project">
		<h3 class="center long marg-bot"> 3. I take pictures of beautiful restrooms. </h3>
		<p class="center long"> While traveling or just visiting a place, I always take a look at the restrooms. I mostly expect them to be clean and private so when a particularly theme is carried out throughout the space or a totally new world is created, I can't help but snap a few pictures. </p>
</section>

<section class="project">
	<h3 class="center long marg-bot"> 4. I'm classically trained in music and dance. </h3>
	<p class="center long"> I've practiced music and dance most of my childhood and have done so in different ways into adulthood. Nowadays, I play piano, sing and dance hip-hop on a weekly basis. </p>
</section>

<section class="project">
	<h3 class="center long marg-bot"> 5. My parents come from Madagascar, I was born in Paris (France) and live in Colorado. </h3>
	<p class="center long"> Yep, this is where my long last name come from :). Also, feel free to join me at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Boulder-French-table-La-Table-Francophone-de-Boulder/"> Boulder French table </a> if you ever want to speak or listen French.
