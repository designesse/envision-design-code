	<p>Hi! I'm Malina Randrianavony, a UX/Product designer based in Colorado.</p>
	<p>As a designer at &#9829;, engineer by trade and artist on occasions, I create experiences with beauty, functionality and meaning in mind.</p>
	<p>With a technical career accross multiple industries, rotating hobbies to challenge my creativity and perspective, and a personal life that spreads across three continents, I am passionate about bridging the gap between disciplines and cultures.</p>
	<p>Most of my skills are self-taught or learned on the job so I do my best work when diving into a new project. I learn about the stakeholders' goals, discover the pressing problems and gather the resources to create a beautiful, functional and meaningful solution.</p>
