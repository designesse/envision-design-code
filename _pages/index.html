Then, we get out there to our users so we can create empathy maps and personas to validate potential problems and solutions.</p>

	<p class="left long"> Let's clarify our constraints and build some iterative prototypes. Now that we understand the why's, we use an iterative process that takes into account user feedback, business goals and technical constraints to build some prototypes. Stripping down complexity, ensuring usability and sprinking delight are our mantra.

	<p class="left long">It's time to bring our ideas and design to life. Nowadays, I am focusing on front-end coding but as a past full-stack dev with 5+ years of experience, I love collaborating with all devs, making sure the designs are easily implemented as well as being the bridge to the technical team.</p>
