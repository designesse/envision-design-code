	<p><em>Hi! I'm Malina Randrianavony, a UX/Product designer based in Colorado.</em></p>
	<p>As a <em>designer at &#9829;</em>, <em>engineer by trade</em> and artist on occasions, I create experiences with beauty, functionality and meaning in mind.</p>
	<p>With a technical career accross multiple industries, rotating hobbies to challenge my creativity and perspective, and a personal life that spreads across three continents, <em>I am passionate about bridging the gap between disciplines and cultures</em>.</p>
	<p><em>Most of my skills are self-taught or learned on the job</em> so I do my best work when diving into a new project. I learn about the stakeholders' goals, discover the pressing problems and gather the resources to <em>create beautiful, functional and meaningful products</em>.</p>

	<img class="round-border" src="{{ site.github.url }}/MalinaRandrianavony-linkedin-picture.jpg" alt="Malina Randrianavony's picture">
	<p>I was born and grew up in Paris, France with Malagasy parents and lived in TX, WY and ND before settling in CO.</p>
	<p>Through a multicultural life and multidisciplinary career, I've noticed better design equals better quality of life. In the complex world we live in, great experiences are few and far between. I hope I get to play a little part in improving the odds.</p>
